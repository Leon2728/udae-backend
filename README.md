# UDAE Backend

This repository contains the backend implementation of **UDAE (Unified Document Audit Engine)**.

UDAE is a **deterministic normative decision engine** for academic and institutional documents.

## What this backend IS
- A rule-based compliance engine
- A deterministic evaluator
- An auditable decision system
- A normative "compiler" for documents

## What this backend IS NOT
- Not a text editor
- Not a formatting tool
- Not an AI writing assistant
- Not a probabilistic or scoring system

## Architectural Principles
- Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
- Monolithic Modular Core
- Microkernel Normative Engine
- Sequential Blocking Pipeline
- Immutable, append-only audit trail
- Hash-based identity for truth
- No LLMs or ML in the decision core

## Status
Architecture locked.
Implementation pending.
